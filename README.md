# Minecraft-function-to-java-array
A little cpp script to convert minecraft functions to a java array so that they can be executed in code



# how to run.
1) put the function inside of "input.txt"
2) run the script ( i used visual studio compiler )
3) put the name for the java array
4) open output.txt and copy the array containing all the command instructions


# Note
- for the script to work you'll neeed to have an instruction per line inside of the function 
- too complex functions may not work, in that case please contact me
